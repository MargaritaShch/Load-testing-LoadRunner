# Project for Writing Scripts in LoadRunner

## Project Overview

This project involves the development of LoadRunner scripts to simulate virtual user scenarios in a ticket booking application. The primary goals are to create scripts for various user actions, implement transactions, checks, correlation, and parameterization, as well as ensure that the scripts are properly structured and functional.

## Implemented Scenarios

Scenario 1: Login and Logout**
Scenario 2: Search for a Ticket without Purchase**
Scenario 3: Purchase a Ticket**
Scenario 4: View List of Travel Itineraries**
Scenario 5: Delete an Existing Booking**
Scenario 6: Register a New User**

## Key Features

- **Transaction Management**: Transactions are set for all requests and business operations to accurately measure performance.
- **Validation**: Checks are implemented for each transaction to ensure the correctness of requests.
- **Correlation and Parameterization**: Dynamic values such as session and flight IDs are correlated, and user input values are parameterized.
- **User Data Preparation**: Data for 10 different user accounts is prepared and stored in a file, ensuring unique sessions for testing..
